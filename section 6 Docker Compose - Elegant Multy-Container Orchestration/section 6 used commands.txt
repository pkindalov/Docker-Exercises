//creating docker-compose.yaml

version: "3.8" 

//version of the docker compose specification we wanna use. Has an effect on the features we can use in this
//compose file. More info on docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/

//all services in docker compose are set in one network by default. But still we can set containers to be in our network and not
//this created by default.

//for named volumes, the key volumes must be next to the services /on the same level, without spaces/. If you use same volume
//name to different services/containers/, then the volume will be shared, so different containers can use the same volume, 
//the same folder on your hosting machine.
