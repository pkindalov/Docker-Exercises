//creating docker-compose.yaml

version: "3.8" 

//version of the docker compose specification we wanna use. Has an effect on the features we can use in this
//compose file. More info on docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/

//all services in docker compose are set in one network by default. But still we can set containers to be in our network and not
//this created by default.

//for named volumes, the key volumes must be next to the services /on the same level, without spaces/. If you use same volume
//name to different services/containers/, then the volume will be shared, so different containers can use the same volume, 
//the same folder on your hosting machine.

//how to start services/containers/ with docker-compose?
//we must open a terminal from directory where docker-compose.yaml is located and then write the following command

docker-compose up

//and then it will not only start the contianers, it also will pull and build all images that can be required

//following commands clear all images I have on the system, so to start on fresh
docker image prune
docker image prune - a
docker container prune

//then from the directory when is docker-compose.yaml located start terminal and write
docker-compose up

//if we don't want to start in detached mode then we can use -d in docker-compose up command
docker-compose up -d

//now if we want to stop all services and remove all containers and so on, we can write
docker-compose down 

 //it don't delete the volumes. If you want to do that you can use -v flag in the following way
 docker-compose down -v
