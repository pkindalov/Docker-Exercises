2.docker run sha256:1b8efcfe223500a581ab7077cb6e6d71409a1076f376b08e9f9b011720e3d487

3.docker ps / to get the name of container. In this case it is stupefied_babbage /
/ps - stands for processes/
docker ps - a will show all the containers. Including the stopped ones.

4.docker stop naughty_dirac

5.docker ps --help you will see all available config options for the command docker ps

6.docker start container_name  - restart stopped container. If there are no changes in the code
It is better to restart container with this command instead of docker run

docker run -it container_name - interactive..waiting to enter something.
docker start -a -i container_name - restart container in attach and interactive mode.

docker rm container_name - removes container but if it is stopped. If it is running then an error is thrown. It is possible to
remove more containers at one. Just must be separate with space each other. For example

docker rm container_name1 container_name2 container_name3 container_name4

docker images - show list with  all images we have

docker rmi - removes images. We can remove images only if they are not used from some container without matter if it
is stopped or not. Container must be removed first.

docker image prune - this command remove all unused images.




IMPORTANT

docker run - you create a new container based on the image every time. Also, this command
is BLOCKING THE TERMINAL. Attach(means that we are listening to the output of that container. For example what is printed to the console.) mode is the default.

 It can be start on detach mode through the -d parameter. For example:
docker run -d container_name.

We can attach to the container again through the command attach. For example
docker attach container_name 

docker start - NOT BLOCKING THE TERMINAL. Detach mode is by default.

docker logs container_logs - show to us past logs that were printed by that container
docker logs -f container_name we can attach again to the container
