5.docker ps --help you will see all available config options for the command docker ps

6.docker start container_name  - restart stopped container. If there are no changes in the code
It is better to restart container with this command instead of docker run



IMPORTANT

docker run - you create a new container based on the image every time. Also, this command
is BLOCKING THE TERMINAL. Attach(means that we are listening to the output of that container. For example what is printed to the console.) mode is the default.

 It can be start on detach mode through the -d parameter. For example:
docker run -d container_name.

We can attach to the container again through the command attach. For example
docker attack container_name 

docker start - NOT BLOCKING THE TERMINAL. Detach mode is by default.

docker logs container_logs - show to us past logs that were printed by that container
docker logs -f container_name we can attach again to the container
